SASIP will use machine learning and data assimilation to exploit large datasets obtained from both simulations and remote sensing.
Through the further development of existing important state-of-the-art simulators created by some of the investigators, SASIP will build a data-constrained sea ice model that is based on solid-like physics.</description></item></channel></rss>
