Sea ice is at the heart of numerous climate feedbacks that occur in polar regions and that can play an important role in observed and projected Arctic amplification of surface air temperature increase. Hence, we expect that a more accurate representation of sea ice dynamics would lead to a better climate mean state and variability in sea-ice covered areas. Whether this matters for representing the climate response to increased CO2 in polar regions and beyond remains an open question.

WP5 will focus on assessing the climate implications of the state-of-the-art sea ice modelling framework being developed during SASIP. Our work will be divided into two parts:
  - Building a global fully coupled GCM including the new sea ice modeling system
  - Identifying the climate impacts both in polar and mid latitude regions of the new sea ice representation using a fully coupled framework.
