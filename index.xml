When developing the Maxwell-Elasto-Brittle rheological model for sea ice, we chose to go Eulerian and to make use of the Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Their implementation and first results are presented here. This work will be pursued within SASIP, Work Package 1.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Webinar #1 - Véronique Dansereau</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/news/webinar1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/news/webinar1/</guid><description>The thin ice covering the polar oceans is a complex geomaterial that is constantly breaking and moving under the action of the winds and ocean currents.

One of SASIP&amp;rsquo;s primary goals is to improve the representation of marginal ice zones, especially wave-ice and floe size interactions.

To accomplish this we will improve the numerical efficiency of its underlying C++ code and perform exploratory work to enable continued improvements in model efficiency beyond those immediately necessary for integrating it into a climate model.
WP1 is divided into five tasks, two of which address known shortcomings of the current model version, two which aim to push the numerical performanc eof the model further and one concerned with evaluating the physical consistency of the results obtained with the updated model code.</description></item><item><title>WP2 Sea Ice Rheology — Physical Parameterizations</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-two/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-two/</guid><description>We are concerned with enhancing the mechanical parametrizations of the rheological framework employed in the continuum sea ice model developed within SASIP.
The aim is to develop physically sound parametrizations that can translate the dependence of the mechanical strength of the ice cover at the large scale (10-100 km) on both its granular concentration and level of fracturing at the small scale (&amp;lt; 10 km), thereby enabling the rheological framework to represent adequately the spatial and temporal mechanical transition between a dense, brittle ice pack and a loose, granular aggregate of ice floes reminiscent of the Marginal Ice Zone.</description></item><item><title>WP3 Ice–Ocean Interactions</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-three/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-three/</guid><description>Across a single sea ice floe just a few meters wide, upper ocean exchanges of heat, momentum, and freshwater can vary by two orders of magnitude. Ocean surface waves flex and fragment sea ice altering its geometry, driving ocean mixing and sea ice melting. These effects, and their important impact on sea ice and ocean variability, are forced by variations in sea ice geometry much smaller than a continuum climate model grid scale.</description></item><item><title>WP4 Data Assimilation — Machine Learning</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</guid><description>We complement the model development efforts of the other WPs by providing data-constrained sea ice analyses. To meet this goal we shall develop specific and novel data assimilation (DA) methods adapted to the new continuum version of the sea ice model neXtSIM discretised using discontinuous Galerkin method. WP4 will also use state-of-the art DA and machine learning (ML) methods not used in sea ice modeling before, and develop novel approaches for the unique computational and physical features of neXtSIM.</description></item><item><title>WP5 Climate Implications</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-five/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/research/work-package-five/</guid><description>Sea ice is at the heart of numerous climate feedbacks that occur in polar regions and that can play an important role in observed and projected Arctic amplification of surface air temperature increase. Hence, we expect that a more accurate representation of sea ice dynamics would lead to a better climate mean state and variability in sea-ice covered areas. Whether this matters for representing the climate response to increased CO2 in polar regions and beyond remains an open question.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:15:34 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/about/</guid><description>The Scale-Aware Sea Ice Project aims to develop a truly innovative, scale-aware continuum sea ice model for climate research; one that faithfully represents sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics and that is physically sound, data-adaptive, highly parallelized and computationally efﬁcient. SASIP will use machine learning and data assimilation to exploit large datasets obtained from both simulations and remote sensing.
Through the further development of existing important state-of-the-art simulators created by some of the investigators, SASIP will build a data-constrained sea ice model that is based on solid-like physics.</description></item><item><title>Success</title><link>https://test-new-template.github.io/contact/success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-new-template.github.io/contact/success/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
